          I&apos;m an indie hacker from Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³. I&apos;m currently working
          in Japan. <br />I started how to code in 2021 and fell in love with it
          since. I enjoyed figuring out the logic behind building applications,
          but I was more attracted to how to make it look delightful to users.
          That&apos;s how I started my career in front end development.
